Instructions:

Step 1: base structure<br>
Write the base structure for the project in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Within the HTML, put a click button which will increment a counter and a label initialised at 0 to display said counter.

Step 2: prepare the JavaScript<br>
In your JavaScript prepare variables to allow you to control your button and label. You will also need a variable to keep track of the score.

Step 3: increase the score<br>
When you click the button, increase the variable storing the score by 1, then display the current score inside the label.

Step 4: make a multiplier<br>
Add another button which will act as a multiplier. When called this button will permanently multiply the number of points per click, by two for example.

Step 5: price of multiplier<br>
The multiplier allows you to have a big score quickly, that shouldn’t be free, it should be a purchase made with the current player score.

Step 6: no credit<br>
You can’t make credit, meaning that the player cannot have a negative score. Think about updating the score display after a purchase.

Step 7: display multiplier counter<br>
Display the counter within the multiplier. For example, if the counter is worth 5, then the button should display something like multiplier x5.

Step 8: increase the cost<br>
Buying a lot of multiplier is way too easy. For more fun, make it so that each time a multiplier is purchased the cost of buying a new one is increased.

Step 9: display the cost<br>
In the text of the multiplier button you should also have the price of the upgrade.

Step 10: auto-clicker<br>
Implement a new improvement to buy, the auto-click. As the name might suggest this bonus will automatically add a click to your score each x seconds.

Step 11: bonus<br>
Implement yet another improvement to buy, the bonus. It should grant the player a boost in score of 200% per click for 30 seconds. When purchased the player should see a timer with the remaining time inside the bonus button.

Step 12: deactivate the buttons<br>
Make it so that, if the player doesn’t have the points to purchase a multiplier, an auto-click or an other bonus, he can’t.

Step 13: make it pretty<br>
Your cookie clicker must be pretty, make it look good with CSS or some extra JavaScript.
